# FORESENSE
Integration of SW520D tilt sensor, MQ-2 gas sensor, and active buzzer as an alarm system.

    from machine import Pin, ADC
    import time
    
    gas_sensor = ADC(Pin(26))    #The first setup is the gas sensor, using an analog output for more accurate readings. It is connected to pin 26 or GPIO 26.
    tilt_sensor = Pin(15, Pin.IN)    #The second setup is the tilt sensor, which uses a digital input to quickly sense vibrations. GPIO 15 is the input pin, while Pin.IN reads its state (HIGH or LOW).
    buzzer = Pin(16, Pin.OUT)    #The third setup configures the buzzer as a digital output. GPIO 16 controls its state to sound an alarm.
    switch = Pin(14, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)    #The fourth setup is the switch, which controls the alarm system. It uses a digital input with a pull-up resistor. The switch works in an active LOW configuration (pulling the pin LOW when pressed). GPIO 14 is the input pin, with Pin.PULL_UP enabling the pull-up resistor.

    
    threshold = 14500     #The threshold value determines the gas sensorâ€™s trigger point. If the sensor reading exceeds this value, the alarm is activated. The value can be adjusted based on environmental testing.

    #Finally, two variables prevent multiple triggers in a short time:
    last_trigger_time = 0    #last_trigger_time records the last alarm activation,
    debounce_delay = 5    #while debounce_delay sets a minimum 5-second interval between triggers. Both sensors share the same buzzer, so this delay avoids false alarms.
